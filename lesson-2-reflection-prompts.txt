What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder .git is created telling git that the current folder is  git repository.
All files and subdirectories are potentially part of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is a plain directory with files tracked by git but also with files
not being part of the repository. Staging area is an intermediate area between the working
directory and the repository. It allows us to pick certain files which go into the next commit.
This mechanism faciliates our aim to separate logical changes in different commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
